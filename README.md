## Purposes and Goals
The purpose of this app is to make the process of creating a group chat for friends/classmates/teammates easier. 

Currently in order to send group messages, people have to create group chats on facebook by sending friend requests and manually inviting one by one. This has three problems:
* Inviting people one by one is tedious;
* Mutual strangers have to become friends to invite;
* Not everyone has a facebook account.


The goal of this app is therefore to make this process easy and seamless. It will only require a user's name to sign up, and when creating a group chat, the user will press a button ("create a new group" button) and a random 4-digit code is created. Using this 4-digit code, other classmates can join the group. We are also planning to implement a function which can add people who are around the user based on the location, and send invitations to them. This is done by using "google nearby api". It is an api that can make a device interact with other nearby devices in ways such as sending messages and notifications. For those who do not attend the class the day the group is created, we add a feature where a user can add another person to the group using the similar methods.

##  User Stories and User Cases

1.	John

John is a student and does not have a facebook account, yet he wants to connect to his classmates to discuss the issues related to class. Unfortunately, he finds the email system very tedious and is told that no one uses it. He is looking for a system where he can keep his privacy, yet connect with his friends from the class.

John opens the application. He creates a simple account just with the username which he makes abstract (making his real name in disguise). Then he joins the group chat that his classmates have created.

2. Suzie

Suzie is a student who loves saving time. She hates to do lots of additional things when she can do something simply. Whenever she has a group project she has to create a facebook chat, which is tedious. If not her, then there are not many volunteers to do so. Also, not everyone has facebook account and then she has a problem with reaching out to everyone. She is looking for some simple way to communicate with new groups on demand.

Suzie is with her group in the room. She opens the application and starts a new group. She is looking for a group formation based on location. She quickly finds her 3 other members of the group and forms a group with them.

3. Mr. Headman

Mr. Headman is a professor at NYUAD. He has noticed that the system created by the University, NYU classes, is very sloppy and not all the students want to use it. He would like an easier way to communicate with his students and encourage outside-the-class discussion. He would like to be able to easily create the group during his first class.

Mr. Headman opens the application. He creates a new group by generating its access code. He writes down the access code on the blackboard. Students open their applications and join the group based on the code - the are automatically assigned to the teacher's group. Now Mr. Headman can message every student with the easiness of a chat and he knows everyone is in it.
