# GroupApp
Our app makes creating group chats for students in class easy and seamless.

## Purposes and Goals
The purpose of this app is to make the process of creating a group chat for classes easier. Currently, the way to connect to people in class and send messages to everyone at the same time is to make a group chat on facebook. However, this proves bothersome, as one student from the class has to find out every other student in class on facebook and manually add one by one. Moreover, it is usually the case that he or she is not friends with all the students in class, which makes it hard to ensure that everyone is in the group chat. In most cases, not everyone has a facebook account as well, which makes this way of connecting with others in class imperfect.

The goal of this app is therefore to make this process easy and seamless. It will only require a user's name to sign up, and when creating a group chat, the user will press a button ("create a new group" button) and a random 4-digit code is created. Using this 4-digit code, other classmates can join the group. We are also planning to implement a function which can add people who are around the user based on the location (we will use google nearby api to locate other users), and send invitations to them. For those who do not attend the class the day the group is created, we add a feature where a user can add another person to the group using the similar methods.

##  User Stories and User Cases

1.	John
John is a student and does not have a facebook account, yet he wants to connect to his classmates to discuss the issues related to class. Unfortunately, he finds the email system very tedious and is told that no one uses it. He is looking for a system where he can keep his privacy, yet connect with his friends from the class.

John opens the application. He creates a simple account just with the username which he makes abstract (making his real name in disguise). Then he joins the group chat that his classmates have created.
